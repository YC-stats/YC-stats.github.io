I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Illinois State University.  Before this, I worked as a visiting Assistant Professor at Reed College. From September 2023 to August 2024, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta, working with Professor Bei Jiang at the University of Alberta and Professor Anne-Sophie Charest at Université Laval. From March 2022 to August 2023, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, mentored by Professor Zhou Zhou in the Department of Statistical Sciences.
I completed my Ph.D. degree from School of Mathematics at Jilin University of China in December 2020.
